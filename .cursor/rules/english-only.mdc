# English-Only Coding Standard

When working on this codebase:

- All code comments must be written in English
- All documentation (including README, inline docs, etc.) must be in English
- All variable names, function names, and other identifiers should use English words
- All commit messages should be in English
- All PR descriptions and discussions should be in English

This ensures better collaboration and maintainability across international teams and contributors.
